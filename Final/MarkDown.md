Countries and Capitals Quiz
=======


This program tests a user's knowledge of the 
capitals and countries of the world across
all landmasses and oceans.

TO USE:

Copy and paste the code into a text/code 
runner and hit run. When a country's name pops
up, supply the correct capital to that country.

MOTIVATION:

I made this program because I'm interested in
improving my knowledge of the world's countries.
